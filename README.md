# RedUSB
 
This is my collection of payloads that I have that are generally more red team focused.

I run these on a USB I have, not my Flipper for BadUSB.

This is mainly for my learning so I can experiment with red team scripting and payloads.

**DO NOT USE THESE PAYLOADS ON ANYTHING YOU DON'T OWN OR HAVE PERMISSION TO TEST ON.**
